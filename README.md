# dotfiles
My Linux setup is just in the root directory and is currently a very plain setup using zsh and PowerLevel10k for displaying python venv, directory and git status all in one line with the dark theme set. 

I'm planning to look into customizing neovim at some point as well.

## Windows
In the windows folder I also documented a simple setup I have on my Windows system that adds a powerlevel based theme to Git Bash. I did have to do some workarounds and change some Windows Terminal settings to get it to work so those are documented there.
