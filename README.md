# dotfiles
My Linux setup just in the root directory here is currently a very simple setup using zsh and PowerLevel10k for displaying python venv, directory and git status all in one line with the dark theme set. 

I'm planning to look into customizing neovim at some point as well.

## Windows
I also documented a simple setup I have on my Windows system that adds a powerlevel based theme to Git Bash. I did have to do some workarounds and change some Windows Terminal settings to get it to work so those are documented here.
